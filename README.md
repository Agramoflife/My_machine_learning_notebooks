# My Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook files related to various machine learning topics and projects that I have done. These notebooks serve as educational resources and examples for understanding and implementing machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## I have covered supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and this is for my future references
