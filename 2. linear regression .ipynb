In other words, it's the part of the variation in the data that can be accounted for and explained by the model's parameters and features.\n",

Residuals can arise due to factors that are not captured by the model, measurement errors, or inherent randomness in the underlying process being modeled.\n",

    "Imagine you're playing with toy cars, and you want to know how fast they go when you push them. You decide to measure how hard you push the cars (that's your \"input\") and how far they travel (that's your \"output\").\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Square Due to Regression:**\n",
    "   - This is like when you draw a line to show how hard you pushed the cars and how far they went. If your line matches the real results really well, it means you're good at predicting how far the cars will go when you push them harder or softer.\n",
    "   - So, if your line is very close to the actual results, this number is big, and it shows you're good at guessing.\n",

    "Exactly! You're on the right track. Here's what you have done so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pushing the Car:** You pushed the toy cars and measured how hard you pushed them (this is like your \"input\") and how far they traveled (this is like your \"output\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Collection:** You did this 40 times, so you have 40 pairs of measurements (input and output).\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Line or Curve:** After you plotted the points, you can draw a line or curve that tries to go through the points in the best way possible. This line or curve is like your guess or prediction about how hard you push and how far the car goes. This is the function you mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Understanding the Relationship:** The line or curve you drew is your way of understanding how pushing the car (input) is related to how far it goes (output). The slope of the line or the shape of the curve tells you about this relationship. If the line goes up, it means pushing harder makes the car go farther. If it goes down, it means pushing harder makes the car go less far.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Mean Squares:** Now, the \"Mean Square Due to Regression\" and \"Mean Square Due to Error\" come in. These numbers help you see how well your line or curve fits the real measurements. If the line is close to the points, your Mean Square Due to Regression is big, and it means you did a good job understanding the relationship. If your line is close to the real measurements, your Mean Square Due to Error is small, and it means your guesses are pretty good.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps help you know if your guesses are accurate and how well your function (line or curve) describes the connection between pushing the car and how far it goes. It's like figuring out a puzzle and making sure your guess is as close as possible to what really happens."
